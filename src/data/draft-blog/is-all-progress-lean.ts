# Is all growth lean?
## Are there Parallels Between Muscle Building and Product Development

In fitness, there's a well-known strategy off "bulking and cutting." This approach involves intentionally gaining weight (both muscle and fat) before strategically reducing body fat to build and grow more lean muscle.
Recently, I found myself drawing a parallel between this concept and the process of product development.

The bulking and cutting cycle in fitness involves increasing complexity (adding mass) before refining and simplifying (cutting fat). 
Why do this in the first place? It's notoriously difficult to just put on lean muscle mass. In the same way, it's also notoriously difficult to only build value-add features.

There's this cycle of intentional complexity increase followed by strategic simplification can be observed in other areas too. 

## Feature Bulking
In the early stages of product development, teams often engage in a "feature bulking" phase. This involves:

1. **Exploration and Ideation**: Developers and product managers brainstorm and implement various features, some of which may not make it to the final product.
2. **Prototype Development**: Creating multiple prototypes or minimum viable products (MVPs) to test different concepts and functionalities.
3. **User Feedback Collection**: Gathering extensive user feedback on various features and use cases.
4. **Technology Experimentation**: Trying out different technologies, frameworks, or architectural approaches.

*This phase is characterized by an increase in product complexity as new features and functionalities are added, much like how muscle mass and overall body weight increase during a bulking phase in bodybuilding.*

## Feature Cutting

Once the initial exploration and development phase is complete, product teams enter a "feature cutting" phase:

1. **Feature Prioritization**: Identifying core features that provide the most value to users and align with the product vision.
2. **Simplification**: Streamlining the user interface and experience by removing unnecessary elements.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Refining the codebase and architecture to improve speed and efficiency.
4. **Focus on Core Value Proposition**: Ensuring that the product clearly delivers on its primary promise to users.

This phase parallels the cutting phase in bodybuilding, when people trim fat and grow leaner.

Here's the big idea: pure lean growth is hard; adding complexity is sometimes a necessary prerequisite. Here's a few examples I found.


* *Scientific Research*: Theories often become more complex as new data is discovered and incorporated. Eventually, a simpler, more elegant theory may emerge that explains the phenomena more effectively
* *Writing and Editing*: Authors often begin with a "bulky" first draft, including numerous ideas, scenes, and characters. The editing process then "cuts" this initial complexity down to a more refined and focused final product.
* *Organizational Structure*: Companies may go through periods of expansion, adding departments and roles, before realizing the need to streamline and simplify their structure for better efficiency.
* *Manufacturing Processes*: Manufacturing companies might initially develop complex production lines with numerous steps and components. Over time, they often find ways to simplify and optimize these processes, as exemplified by Toyota's lean manufacturing principles.

Embracing this cycle of increasing and then decreasing complexity can offer several advantages. It's hard to comprehensively explore options and innovations without the "bulk" phase in any product.
It's also harder to gather customer insights when you're building fewer features slowly instead of increasing complexity in the short-term to later provide a more unifying experience. Finally, like anything, an iterative model is required. Staying too lean can hamper with this.

A few final ideas on using some concepts from bulking and cutting in product development:
* Embrace Exploration: The bulk phase of a product is all about innovation. Not all AI features will land. Going broad will define the roadmap for going deep.
* Refine with Context: Sometimes, it's not even data; sometimes, it's customer interviews. but context is key to simplifying the customer experience

This is especially true for features relying on new capabilities such as new AI models. There's a lot of uncertainity; experimentation is your best friend. Don't make all features sacred; there's a time to cut features and simplify.
A few years ago, everyone had chat interfaces; now, everyone talks about AI agents. It's vital to know what to cut when.

The path to simplicity leads through complexity. Embrace the process, and trust that the final "cut" will reveal something truly remarkable.
